# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to collect, process, and clean a data set. The objective is to create tidy data that can be easily used for subsequent analysis. The data consists of measurements from the accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Files in the Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: This script performs the data analysis.
- `tidy_data.txt`: This is the final output, a tidy data set.
- `CodeBook.md`: This document describes the variables, data, and transformations applied during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file explains the analysis files and how they are related.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset and unzip it.
2. Run the `run_analysis.R` script to generate the tidy data set.
3. Consult the `CodeBook.md` for details on the variables and transformations used.
